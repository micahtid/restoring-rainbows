// About Us Page
export const aboutPageMissionStatement = `Restoring Rainbows is an international, youth-led nonprofit dedicated to making art accessible while protecting the planet. Our mission is to educate and empower diverse communities about the critical connections between art and climate change. With hundreds of volunteers across dozens of countries, we've already made a positive impact on countless lives.\n Restoring Rainbows is a certified 501(c)3 nonprofit organization registered in the United States of America.`

export const aboutPageOurStory = `
Both Jordan Chen and Grace Millard had a passion for art and recognized the importance and happiness that comes from making art. They never lacked the supplies or the resources to make art, but quickly realized this wasn't the case for everyone with one-third of households in the U.S. not being able to afford basic school supplies, let alone extras like paint or canvases.
At the same time, Jordan and Grace were struck by the large quantities of plastic markers and other supplies being discarded in schools—excess on one side, and necessity on the other. As they did more research they became increasingly alarmed by both the lack of access to educational materials, and the global climate crisis. They noticed an opportunity to close the divide by repurposing unused materials and giving them to those who needed them the most.
Through Restoring Rainbows Jordan and Grace have personally seen the kindness of certain individuals and the meaningful influence of others, motivating them to keep promoting art accessibility and sustainability globally.
`

export const aboutPageProblem = `Today, millions of students around the world don't have access to basic art supplies — yet art education is proven to boost creativity, academic achievement, and emotional well-being. Without materials like markers, paints, and paper, many young people are unable to explore their creativity or develop skills that could shape their futures.

At the same time, billions of school supplies and art materials are thrown away each year, contributing to plastic waste and environmental harm. While some communities lack access to tools for learning and self-expression, others have resources that could be restored and shared — but without systems to collect, recycle, and redistribute them, these supplies often go to waste.

We believe that connecting these gaps is essential: not just to provide materials, but to empower students everywhere to create, learn, and express themselves — while protecting the planet through sustainable practices.`
